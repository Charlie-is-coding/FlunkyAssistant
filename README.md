# FlunkyAssistant
Flunky game assistant. 

This is a concept of an assistant for Flunky* - a real-life drinking game.

Programm will be developed in Python 3 composed with JS for front-end data visualization (players stats, game stats, etc.) with a database to hold players and games info.

Further this project will be developed into fully working mobile app. (Hopefully.)

*Flunky - a fast paced, 'stategy/accuracy',  full of emotions, environement friendly, all-family outdoor game.
